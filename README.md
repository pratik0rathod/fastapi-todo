The goal of this project is to create a simple todo application using FastAPI. The application will allow users to create, read, update, and delete todo items. Additionally, users will be able to create an account, authenticate, and manage their own todo lists.

**Features:**

1. **User Authentication**:
    - User registration and login
    - Password hashing and verification
    - JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication
2. **Todo Items**:
    - Create a new todo item (title, description, due date)
    - Read a list of all todo items for the authenticated user
    - **Read a specific todo item by ID**
    - Update an existing todo item (if the user is the owner)
    - Mark a todo item as complete/incomplete
    - Delete a todo item (if the user is the owner)
3. **User Management**:
    - Users can update their profile information (e.g., username, email, password)
    - Users can delete their account
4. **Database Integration**:
    - Use a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite) to store user information and todo items
    - Integrate an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library like SQLAlchemy
5. **API Documentation**:
    - Use FastAPI's automatic documentation generation (Swagger UI or ReDoc)

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Set up the FastAPI project**:
    - Create a new FastAPI project using the FastAPI CLI or manually
    - Define the project structure (e.g., routes, models, services, utils)
2. **Define Pydantic models**:
    - Create Pydantic models for User, TodoItem, and other necessary data structures
3. **Implement user authentication**:
    - Create routes for user registration and login
    - Use a library like `passlib` for password hashing and verification
    - Implement JWT-based authentication
4. **Implement CRUD operations for todo items**:
    - Create routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting todo items
    - Implement appropriate access control (e.g., only allow users to manage their own todo items)
5. **Implement user management**:
    - Create routes for updating user profiles and deleting user accounts
6. **Database integration**:
    - Set up a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite)
    - Use an ORM like SQLAlchemy to interact with the database
    - Define database models for User and TodoItem
7. **API documentation**:
    - Use FastAPI's automatic documentation generation to create Swagger UI or ReDoc documentation
8. **Testing**:
    - Write unit tests for your routes, services, and utilities
    - Consider integration tests to ensure the application works as expected
9. **Deployment**:
    - Deploy the FastAPI application to a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean)
